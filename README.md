# Simple Fabric+Mods Installer
A Script that generates a simple installer to allow non-tech people to use a fabric modded server

# Requirements
- Python 3
- Windows (might be cross-platform at some point)

# Usage
- Place `fabric-installer-x.x.x.jar`(perferably the latest) in the `src/` directory
- Place mods you want included in the `src/mods/` directory
- Run `build.bat`
- Distribute the resulting `FabricInstaller.exe` to your fabric server clients
